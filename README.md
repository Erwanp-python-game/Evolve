You have to choose at each turn where you want to send your group of creature and try to keep a population high enough to breed. Evolution of your creatures is guided by where you send them.

You can see your creature in details and how it has changed during its evolution in a dedicated tab. You will obtain a unique creature in each game with its own history! Moreover you can split your group of creatures leading to a speciation, sister species will roam your world and evolve on their own.
